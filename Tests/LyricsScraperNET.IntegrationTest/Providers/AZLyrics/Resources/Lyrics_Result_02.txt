Now,
Your heroes have fallen.
Championless,
The seas are rising.

So torch every banner,
Every hope of surviving.
This storm is breaking.
Security has left you,
Treading water.

Now taste the fear.
Taste the uncertainty.

What will you do?
When there's nothing left for you to cling to.
What will you do?
With your one last breathe.
Thrive in your emptiness.

Burn all you love.
There's no hope for the weak.
Our heroes have died.

No heart...
No Hope.

Face to face,
With the Abyss (with the Abyss),
One by one they fall away
And won't be missed

Can you hear it?
Can you hear the sound?
As our broken Idols,
Come crashing down.

Now taste the fear.
Now, taste, the, fear.

Burn all you love.
There's no hope for the weak.
Our Heroes have died.
Burn all you love.
There's no hope for the weak.

Burn all you love
