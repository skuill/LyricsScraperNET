Now,
Your heroes have fallen
Champion-less
The seas are rising

So torch every banner,
Every hope of surviving
Lifetime is waking
Security has left you
Treading water

Now taste the fear
Tasting the uncertainty

What will you do? (What will you do?)
When there's nothing left for you to cling to
What will you do? (What will you do?)
When your life has rot
Thrive in your emptiness

Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Your heroes have died

There is...
No Hope.

For it still flies
In the Abyss (In the Abyss)
I'll find one
Beg for a way
Out from the nest

Can you hear it?
Can you hear the sound?
As our broken Idols
Come crashing down.

Now taste the fear
Now, taste the fear

Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak
Your Heroes have died
Burn all you love
There's no hope for the weak

Burn all you love
