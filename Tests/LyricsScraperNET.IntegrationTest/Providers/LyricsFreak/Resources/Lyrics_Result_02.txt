[Intro]
I spoke a vow today and asked if God would come and play
I've dug a shallow hole for him to sleep
But I swear he just won't answer me
I call on out is he afraid, I'll bury him down with the ones he keeps
And if the devil is listening, I'll come for him as well
If I suspect he had a hand to play
And if I see his face in town, there's room for two down underground
Nothing's gonna stop me till I'm done
Until I'm done!
Until I'm done!
Until I'm done!
Until I'm done!
'Cause tonight I'm killing gods!
Killing gods!

[Verse 1]
It's guilt and frustration, it's everything between
The silence and the absence hitting home
Peripheral glances and the chasing of a sound
I never knew I'd miss until it's gone
So ask me how I'm coping, and I'll smile and tell you: "I'm just fine"
While down inside I'm drowning in the fucking rain
Because when everything is empty and your heart is set to cave
Sometimes all you wish for is a place, is a place to place the blame

[Chorus]
Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Damn you all 'cause tonight I'm killing gods

[Verse 2]
The incendiary shock wave scorched earth policy
The devastation that only loss will leave
The chants and incantations of daily rituals
A subtle lapse in brutal honesty
So ask me how I'm coping, and I'll smile and tell you: "I'm just fine"
While down inside I'm screaming till I fucking bleed
Because when everyone's expendable and your heart can't take the wait
The last thing that you wish for is the face, is the face to face the pain

[Chorus]
Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Drown you in your wishing wells
Burn your heaven, flood your hell
Damn you all 'cause tonight I'm killing gods

[Outro]
I spoke a vow today and asked if God would come and play
'Cause I just wanna cut that fucker down
Face me, face me, face me, face me
Face me, face me, none survive
Face me, face me, none survive, go
None survive
The Devil and God have died inside me
